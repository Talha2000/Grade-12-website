<h1><u><center><strong>About the Creator</strong></center></h1></u>
<p>My name is Talha Amjad and I am a grade 12 student at Sir Allan Macnab Secondary School. I got into programming at the age of 16. I started having fun coding and telling the computer exactly what i wanted it to do. I highly recommend and encourage others to learn how to program because technology is advancing at an exponential rate and there is and will always be a high demand for programmers. I, myself plan on going into the engineering field to become a computer/software engineer. I understand that other people may want to go into the business or humanities field, but still encourage them to learn some programming because at some point it becomes useful.</p>

<p class="para">I am also a huge fan of Exotic sports cars, and definitly can not wait for the future when self-driving electric cars become the new sports cars. The effort and time that it takes to program a car that can map out roads and safely transport you from one place to another is astonishing. These new electric cars are made by Tesla, and the future for them is very bright. Programming is the reason why it has gotten this far in technology and it will only get better because as technology advances, programmers come out with more efficient ways of executing tasks.
