<p class="para">People who program can communicate with computers, which is becoming more and more important now that computers have a hand in almost everything. In todayâ€™s IT-literate world, we are all expected to be fluent in word processing and spreadsheets. The next logical step is to be able to program.
<tr>
<p class="para">There are <b>MANY</b> computer languages for <u>different</u> purposes. C and C++ remain the fastest to execute and are used by the gaming industry, for instance. In the internet era, much of the page design is done with the likes of JavaScript or PHP. Meanwhile Python has been <strong>rapidly</strong> gaining a reputation as a general purpose code that is easy to learn. Learning a new language is like learning how to program, you must learn to <u>express</u> yourself within the rules of the language. There is a grammar to comprehend. And what you write must be interpretable by another human being, whereas, in the world of programming, you are telling the computer exactly what to do.

<p class="para">Technology is advancing at an exponential rate and programming has become a necessity in today's world because every device that we hold is programmed to do specific tasks. Just as languages open up the ability to communicate with worlds of people, programming gives children the ability to create technologies that impact those around them. With just a computer, kids can use their programming skills to build things that could change the world.
